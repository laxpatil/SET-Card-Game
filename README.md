# SET-Card-Game
"Set" is a card game where a group of players try to identify a "set" of cards from those placed face-up on a table.


Each card has an image on it with 4 orthogonal attributes:
1. Color (red, green, or purple)
2. Shape (diamond, squiggle, or oval)
3. Shading (solid, empty, or striped)
4. Number (one, two, or three)
Three cards are a part of a set if, for each property, the values are all the same or all different.


#From Wikipedia:

Several games can be played with these cards, all involving the concept of a set. A set consists of three cards which satisfy all of these conditions:

1. They all have the same number, or they have three different numbers.
2. They all have the same symbol, or they have three different symbols.
3. They all have the same shading, or they have three different shadings.
4. They all have the same color, or they have three different colors.

 The rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into "Two of ____ and one of _____," then it is not a set.
