# SET-Card-Game
"Set" is a card game where a group of players try to identify a "set" of cards from those placed face-up on a table.


Each card has an image on it with 4 orthogonal attributes:
 Color (red, green, or purple)
 Shape (diamond, squiggle, or oval)
 Shading (solid, empty, or striped)
 Number (one, two, or three)
Three cards are a part of a set if, for each property, the values are all the same or all different.

Methods:
1. Class Card     (Card)
2. SET operations (SetMethods)
3. Play game       (startGame)


To start playing game, just execute  "startGame.java "  file. It will generate al possible
combinations of cards and generate all SETs and print it.

"SetMethods.java" : contains all the oprations/methods that are necessary to play game SET.
